# What Should Be Done Before Release In Wild WizDen's Hub?

## No Code
- [] Port sounds from **NotLifeWeb** forks. Also, need replace some sounds for medieval-fantasy like.
- [] Port sprites from **NotLifeWeb**.
- [] Make some basic game world. Maybe based on planet generation, idk.
- [] Make logo, icons and better repository description with fork's name.
- [] Replace lobby screens with postal mission's background.

## C# + Another staff
- [] Make another debug config. Station dev map is not good testing area for fork's staff.
- [] Restyle UI with custom stylesheet. Also, there need rework some hardcoded elements in UIs (like PopupSystem)
- [] Port any EPR staff from [Lost-Paradise](https://github.com/Lost-Paradise-Project/Lost-Paradise.git).
- [] Port S.P.E.C.I.A.L. from Nuclear 14.
- [] Make whitelist system. It should be work only on server. Maybe with discord implementation for bot application.
- [] Make alternative ambient system, or dive in black hole of sloth's ambient prototypes.
- [] Make base gamerule for round game, based on dynamic scenario of Gothic 0.56c.
- [] Make barrier, what can push players in, but cannot be push out.
